# 📦 Air Cargo Case Study: Data Analysis & Route Optimization

This repository contains the data analysis and recommendations I developed for a logistics optimization case study, conducted as part of an interview process. The study focuses on optimizing the cargo distribution routes for Air Cargo, an Alaska-based logistics company.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Air Cargo transports various goods—including electronics, food/drinks, and pharmaceuticals—via two aircraft (Alpha and Bravo), each with different capacities and operating costs. The goal was to optimize their cargo distribution routes to meet daily volume targets efficiently, reducing costs and maximizing revenue.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify gaps between target and actual volumes distributed.
- Quantify the financial impact of these gaps.
- Optimize current distribution routes to improve efficiency.
- Recommend the ideal aircraft type if the fleet expands.
- Propose strategies to maximize revenue, particularly in the food/drink category.
- Integrate a new distribution center efficiently.

---

## 📊 Key Insights from Analysis

- Significant untapped revenue in pharmaceutical and food/drink categories.
- Pharmaceuticals offered the highest revenue potential per kilogram.
- Current route inefficiencies provided substantial room for revenue improvement.

## 💡 Recommendations Implemented

### Alpha Aircraft Route Optimization
- **Original Route**: Anchorage → Nome → Fairbanks (1095 miles, $60.27/mile)
- **Optimized Route**: Anchorage → Fairbanks → Nome (792 miles, $120.20/mile)
  - **Result**: Increased Alpha's net revenue per mile by **99%**.

### Bravo Aircraft Load Adjustment
- Adjusted Bravo's load prioritization for Kodiak, fully meeting pharmaceutical targets.
  - **Result**: Increased Bravo’s net revenue per mile by **23%**.
