Air Cargo Case Study: Data Analysis and Route Optimization
Overview
This repository contains my solution and analysis of a logistics optimization case study focused on Alaska-based cargo distribution company "Air Cargo". The analysis was conducted as part of an interview evaluation, where the main objective was to identify inefficiencies, optimize cargo distribution routes, and enhance revenue through strategic data-driven decisions.

Project Context
Air Cargo specializes in distributing electronics, food/drink, and pharmaceutical products using two aircraft types (Alpha and Bravo), each with varying capacities and operational costs. The company aims to meet daily distribution volume targets for Fairbanks, Kodiak, and Nome efficiently and cost-effectively.

Key Objectives
Analyze discrepancies between target and actual distributed volumes.

Evaluate the revenue impact of these discrepancies.

Recommend optimized cargo distribution routes.

Suggest strategic fleet expansions if necessary.

Explore potential to increase revenue, specifically for food/drink products.

Propose strategic integration of a new distribution center.

Analysis Highlights
Identified that pharmaceutical and food/drink categories have substantial untapped revenue potential.

Proposed route modifications that resulted in:

99% increase in Alpha’s net revenue per mile.

23% increase in Bravo’s net revenue per mile.

Achieved full compliance with pharmaceutical distribution targets.

Generated an overall potential revenue increase of 20% through strategic optimization.

Methodology
Conducted exploratory analysis on provided product revenue and volume data.

Calculated potential versus actual revenue generation.

Developed optimization models to enhance efficiency and profitability.
